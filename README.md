I'm rather happy with myself today. I think I did a good job of staying curious and clearly thinking through what I need to know to write code that works.

Creating arrays to iterate over is tricky business. At least doing it for the first time that is. My solution feels elegant enough.

This has helped me:
1. Understand arrays better
2. Understand how to use a loop to manipulate the DOM

Fun stuff :D

Changed this project from an assigned thing from The Odin Project called Etch-a-Sketch to a self-directed project called PixelArted.

### Why the change?

Because I didn't *get* the project when it was assigned to me. Sure, I would have been able to work through the tasks and constraints, but my heart wasn't in it. But now that I've reconceptualized the project in a way that I feel personally invested in, I am far more motivated to flesh it out. As a result, I suspect I will learn more relevant skills and learn more deeply what is actually required to bring an idea to life.

### What *is* the change?

**pixelArted** (pun intended) is going to be a in-browser pixel art canvas. A simple way to make simple designs.

Features:
- custom frame/canvas size and shape;
- custom pixel size (density?);
- custom color picker; 
- "draw mode" settings: click vs drag vs mouseover;
- printable;
- shareable/exportable;
- a public gallery that users can share their work to;

*later that same day* @3:41pm

The colors! They change!! With the clickings!!!

What a fun and crazy coding day! Having to scope out this project is such a challenge. Creativity wants to do EVERYTHING but my mind knows that can't happen. So we compromise, Creativity shares the great ideas (and less than great) while Mind determines what we can actually execute. It's a pretty good system. 

I'm really encouraged by this project. I feel like I'm actually learning how to fly this plane; how to program with fewer and fewer training wheels.

Notes to my future self:
- Always know where your mind is while you're coding. This is an active thinking activity. There's no room for autopilot. Stay aware. Think.
- Don't wait until you have huge chunks of time to sit down for hours and sit in a cozy chair or in a well lit room with a warm cup of tea and noise cancelling headphones to code. Bring that laptop where ever you are, and stay in it. Put in a what ever time you can to actively coding. Reading will be good, but *doing* cannot be replaced or deferred.
