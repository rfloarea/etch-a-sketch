I'm rather happy with myself today. I think I did a good job of staying curious and clearly thinking through what I need to know to write code that works.

Creating arrays to iterate over is tricky business. At least doing it for the first time that is. My solution feels elegant enough.

This has helped me:
1. Understand arrays better
2. Understand how to use a loop to manipulate the DOM

Fun stuff :D

Changed this project from an assigned thing from The Odin Project called Etch-a-Sketch to a self-directed project called PixelArted.

Why the change?

Because I didn't *get* the project when it was assigned to me. Sure, I would have been abler to work through the tasks and constraints, but my heart wasn't in it. But now that I've reconceptualized the project in a way that I feel personally invested in, I am far more motivated to flesh it out. As a result, I suspect I will learn more relevant skills and learn more deeply what is actually required to bring an idea to life.

What *is* the change?

PixelArted (pun intended) is going to be a in-browser pixel art canvas. A simple way to make simple designs.
