I'm rather happy with myself today. I think I did a good job of staying curious and clearly thinking through what I need to know to write code that works.

Creating arrays to iterate over is tricky business. At least doing it for the first time that is. My solution feels elegant enough.

This has helped me:
1. Understand arrays better
2. Understand how to use a loop to manipulate the DOM

Fun stuff :D
